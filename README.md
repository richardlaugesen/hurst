Library for modelling and analysis in Hydrology.

Open Science infrastructure written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

## Status

Under ongoing development and not ready for general use. Don't expect backward compatability at this stage.

## Functionality

Some core functionality has been implemented:

- Hydrologic models
- Calibration
- Simulation
- Data and parameter transformations
- Relative economic value
- Performance metrics
- Visualisations
- Unit conversions

The [documentation](https://tinyrock.github.io/hurst/dev), [examples](https://github.com/tinyrock/hurst/tree/master/examples) and [tests](https://github.com/tinyrock/hurst/tree/master/test) are good places to explore the specific functionality.
